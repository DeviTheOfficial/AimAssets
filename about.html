    <h1>About Crit Crafts</h1>
    <p>
      Hey, I’m D3VI, and this is Aim Assets — a personal stash of game dev goodies I’ve put together over time. Think of it like a scoped-in dump of stuff that actually hits the mark when you’re building a game.

      Most of it’s made for Unity, but let’s be real — you can probably get it working in whatever engine you’re using. This isn’t some polished studio store, just a one-dev armory full of art, audio, code, and random tools that fit the aim of your project’s scope (Ha! get it?).
      
      Download what you need, drop it in, and get back to building cool stuff.
